### Chance Emerson

I have been performing with folk-pop musician Chance Emerson for over six years! Last year we played at Lollapalooza in Chicago, IL, and two years before that we went on tour with Blues Traveler. Check out this live recording of one of our favorite songs! {% include video.liquid path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZmCT5b--Tw" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
