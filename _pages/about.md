Master’s Student at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://tpp.mit.edu/)

Hi! My name is Satch (pronounced like satchel) and I’m a master’s student in the Technology and Policy Program at MIT.

I’m motivated by the question of how to create the greatest positive impact for the most people. I focus on work that is both high-impact and neglected, where contributions at the margin can make the largest difference. This perspective is what led me to AI safety.

I’m currently on the hunt for a research assistantship! My interests within AI safety are very broad and flexible, and span topics including AI control/guardrail design, adversarial testing & red-teaming, and policy design that aligns the incentives of frontier-AI companies with the public interest.

Beyond research, I serve as an AI-focused Challenge Director for the [MIT Policy Hackathon](https://www.mitpolicyhackathon.org/), where I am collaborating with the [Center for Democracy & Technology](https://cdt.org/area-of-focus/ai-policy-governance/). I’m also active in the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community!

Previously, I was a research engineer in the [MIT Electrical Energy Systems group](https://eesg.mit.edu/people), where I worked on software to unify electricity market optimization and transient grid dynamics within a single program. Before that, I studied Electrical Engineering at Brown University, where I directed my research interests towards brain machine interfaces.
