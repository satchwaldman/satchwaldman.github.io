The Digital Brain is a unified productivity and knowledge system that:

- Mirrors your folder structure across all platforms including email, Dropbox, Notion, and Motion, so your information stays consistent everywhere.
- Acts as an auto task manager, automatically routing daily thoughts and notes:
- Information → into the right Notion folders.
- Tasks → into Motion for scheduling.
- This automation system is powered by an AI “Migration Bot”.
- Runs as a Notion integration with AI API calls (in development).

### Upcoming features include:

- **Thread Loom:** a ChatGPT-style conversation tool with infinitely nesting side threads (Slack-style). Conversations can be sent into Notion and processed by the Migration Bot, turning ideas into knowledge entries or tasks.
- **File Parsing & Cleanup Tool:** AI-assisted conversations to help you sort through all your files, notes, and photos—archiving, categorizing, or deleting them with simple yes/no prompts. This lowers cognitive load while speeding up digital organization.
- **Conversation Helpers:** real-time suggestions for what to say in conversations, drawing on your context and knowledge stored in the Digital Brain.
